# Fix for React Label Component Import Issue

## Issue
The application was encountering an error when trying to access the dashboard:
```
Failed to resolve import "@radix-ui/react-label" from "resources/js/Components/ui/label.jsx". Does the file exist?
```

## Solution
I've added the missing dependency `@radix-ui/react-label` to both package.json files:
1. The main package.json in the root directory
2. The mini-crm/package.json file

## Next Steps
After these changes, you need to run:

```bash
# In the root directory
npm install

# In the mini-crm directory
cd mini-crm
npm install
```

This will install the new dependency and resolve the import error, allowing the Label component to function properly.
