# Fix for "@radix-ui/react-label" Import Error

## Problem
The application is encountering the following error when trying to access the dashboard:
```
[plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import "@radix-ui/react-label" from "resources/js/Components/ui/label.jsx". Does the file exist?
```

## Analysis
I checked the project configuration and found:

1. The `@radix-ui/react-label` package is correctly listed in the package.json dependencies (version ^2.0.2)
2. The import statement in `resources/js/Components/ui/label.jsx` is correct:
   ```jsx
   import * as LabelPrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-label"
   ```

## Solution
The error is occurring because although the package is listed in package.json, it's likely not actually installed in the node_modules directory. This can happen when:
- The package was added to package.json but npm install wasn't run afterward
- The node_modules directory was deleted or corrupted
- There was a network error during installation

To fix this issue:

1. Run the following command in your project root directory:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   
   This will install all dependencies listed in package.json, including @radix-ui/react-label.

2. If the above doesn't work, try specifically installing the package:
   ```
   npm install @radix-ui/react-label
   ```

3. After installation, restart your development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

The import should now resolve correctly and the dashboard should load without errors.
